Project contributions

Courtney wrote the code to pull demographic data and and public health-index data and implemented the covariate-adjusted linear model. Haihan wrote the report and helped with formulating the covariate-adjusted linear model. Soumik wrote the code for unadjusted bootstrap-based comparison and created the figures and tables. All three members contributed equally to conceptualising the project.

Please note: given the nature of the tables and figures in the report, we chose not to create a pdf file but use an html-based report instead. Barring the figures and tables, the text falls within the five-page requirement as stated in the  requirements section of the project description on Canvas. The report (excluding figures and tables) is also included in this repository and may be found  [here](https://github.com/soumikp/project625/blob/main/report.pdf).
